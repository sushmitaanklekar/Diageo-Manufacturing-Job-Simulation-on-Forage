Completed a job simulation in which I reviewed the entire bourbon production process for the supply chain and manufacturing team at Diageo.
Analyzed deviations from standard process parameters and identified their underlying causes.Â 
Evaluated downtime data and created a strategic plan to improve operational efficiencies as part of a continuous improvement mindset.
